### Notes: ###

**WiFiSetup**

-Need both USB cables connected + SideSwitch in down position. If the device is off, it isn't working.

-PuTTy Terminal: Serial=COM6 Spee=115200

-For reboot, press and hold the power button for 10 seconds. When lights are off, press again for 5 seconds or until a light flashes.
Then spam the keyboard to run the boot command `run do_ota`

-if you cannot login, don't bother with the devices given. Resetting the password requires an image that is actually too large for the device

-run `configure_edison --wifi` first. No need to connect to a wifi network, however, this step properly setups the wifi direct

-run steps from Chapter 6.3 and Chapter 6.9
